### 3.1 Python scripts - pdb file generation

1. **smiles_to_pdb.py**

    This python script generates a PDB file from a SMILES string and also generates a unique residue code
        for that PDB file by generating and cross-referencing with a database of all generated pdbs. This residue code
        is useful for tracking and analysis of molecules in MD simulations.

    This python file requires the following inputs: <br>
    ```
    Parameters: 
    - smiles (str): SMILES representation of the molecule. 
    - name (str): Name of the molecule. 
    - directory (str): Directory where the PDB file will be saved. 
    - residue_code_csv (str): Path to the CSV file containing existing residue codes. 
    ```
        
    This python script should be run from the "polymer_simulator" directory as follows: <br>
    ```
    python3 python_scripts/smiles_to_pdb.py C methane /pdb_files/molecules /pdb_files/residue_codes.csv 
    ```
    The general form of providing arguments for this script is: <br>
    ```
    python3 python_scripts/smiles_to_pdb.py <smiles> <molecule_name> <pdb_file_directory> <residue_code_csv>
    ```
    
    It is necessary to create the "pdb_files/molecules" directory intially, but the csv should be generated automatically if it does not already exist.

2. **csv_to_pdb.py**

Coming soon...

### 3.2 Python scripts - Molecular dynamics input (paramater/topology) generation 
    
1. **python_parametrizer.py**

    For this section of python scripts - the output from this script is the most important 
        and is required by each subsequent script. In short, this python script parametrizes
        the molecules and the subsequent scripts build systems by calling these parameters. 
        
    This python file requires the following inputs:
    ```
    Parameters:
    - pdb file
    ```
    
    This python script should be run the the "polymer_simulator" directory as follows :
    ```
    python3 python_scripts/python_parametrizer.py path_to_pdb_file.pdb 
    ```
    The general form of providing arguments for this script is: <br>
    ```
    python3 python_scripts/python_parametrizer.py <path_to_pdb_file.pdb> 
    ```
    The "path_to_pdb_file.pdb" path should be something similar: <br>
        "~/polymer_simulator/pdb_files/molecules/pdb_file.pdb"

2. **single_molecule_solvater.py**

    This python script generates the topology and paramaters for a system comprised of a single solvated
        monomer using *AMBER* for molecular dynamics simulations. 
        
    This python file requires the following inputs: <br>
    ```
    Parameters: 
    - molecule_name (str): Name of the molecule. 
    ```
    This python script should be run from the "polymer_simulator" directory as follows: <br>
    ```
    python3 python_scripts/single_molecule_solvater.py methane 
    ```  
    The general form of providing arguments for this script is: <br>
    ```   
    python3 python_scripts/single_molecule_solvater.py <molecule_name> 
    ```
    The AMBER files generated are for a single solvated molecule in a box with dimensions twice 
        that of its max pairwise distance.
        
    If the molecule being solvated has not been previously solvated with **python_parametrizer.py** and
        error will be seen asking you to first parametrize the molecue.

6. **2_2_array_generator.py**

Coming soon...

7. **3_3_array_generator.py**

Coming soon...

### 3.3 Python scripts - Molecular dynamics scripts 

ADD ABOUT GENERATED INPUTS BEING USED FOR THE SCRIPTS - ADD A PART ABOUIT WHAT INPUTS ARE GENERATED FROM EACH SCRIPT
MAYBE ADD PICS OF THEM AS WELL <br>

The prmtop and inpcrd files are generated by the scripts given in section "3.2 python scripts for molecular dynamics input"
and each python script in that section will generate valid inputs for this script. <br>
        
*Note: Other types of paramater and coordiante files will be supported, but for now only **".prmtop"** and **".rst7"** filetypes are supported.*

1. **simple_md_run.py**

    This python script carries out a simple molecular dynamics run - an NVT simulation.
    The default length of this simulation is 10,000 steps with a timestep fo 2 fs - these can be changed manually by editting the script.

    This python file requires the following inputs: <br>
    ```
    Parameters: 
    - prmtop file (str): Parameter file for a system (this file will have the ".prmtop" extension) 
    - inpcrd file (str): Coordinate file for a system (this file will have the ".rst7" extension) 
    ```
    This python script should be run from the "polymer_simulator" directory as follows: <br>
    ```
    python3 python_script/simple_md_run.py path_to_prmtopfile path_to_rst7file 
    ```
    The general form of providing arguments for this script is: <br>
    ```  
    python3 python_scripts/simple_md_run.py <parameter_file> <coordinate_file> 
    ```

      
2. **equilibration_production.py**

    This python script carries out a molecular dynamics simulation in 2 parts: <br>
        1. Equilibration for 1,000,000 steps with a timestep of 2fs (NPT ensemble) <br>
        2. Production run for 2,000,000 steps with a timesept of 2fs (NVT ensemble) <br>
        
    This python file requires the following inputs: <br>
    ```
    Parameters: 
    - prmtop file (str): Parameter file for a system (this file will have the ".prmtop" extension) 
    - inpcrd file (str): Coordinate file for a system (this file will have the ".rst7" extension) 
    ```
        
    This python script should be run from the "polymer_simulator" directory as follows: <br>
    ```
    python3 python_scripts/equilibration_production.py path_to_prmtopfile path_to_rst7file <br>
    ```   
    The general form of providing arguments for this script is: 
    ```  
    python3 python_scripts/equilibration_production.py <parameter_file> <coordinate_file> 
    ```

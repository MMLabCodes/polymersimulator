Introduction
============

Welcome to the **Polymer Simulator** documentation! This tool allows you to build and simulate organic properties using molecular dynamics!

The main features of the Polymer Simulator include:  
- Preparing molecular dynamic simulations (i.e. parameterization, system building)  
- Analyzing molecular dynamic simulations  
- Carrying out various different molecular dynamic simulation 'recipes'  

To get started, please check out the installation instructions below.

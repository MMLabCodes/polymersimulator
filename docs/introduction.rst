Introduction
============

Welcome to the **Polymer Simulator** documentation! This tool allows you to build and simulate organic properties using molecular dynamics!

The main features of the Polymer Simulator include: <br>
- Preparing molecular dynamic simulations (i.e. parameterization, system building) <br>
- Analyzing molecular dynamic simulations <br>
- Carrying out various different molecular dynamic simulation 'recipes' <br>

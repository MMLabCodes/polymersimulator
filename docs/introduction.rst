Introduction
============

Welcome to the **Polymer Simulator** documentation!  
This tool provides a framework for building and simulating organic materials using molecular dynamics (MD).  

Key Features
------------

- **Simulation Preparation** – Parameterization and system building for MD simulations.  
- **Analysis Tools** – Post-processing and analysis of simulation results.  
- **Simulation Recipes** – Ready-to-use workflows for different classes of MD simulations.  

If you are new to Polymer Simulator, start with the :doc:`installation` guide.
